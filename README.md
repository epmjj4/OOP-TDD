 Under the lib folder I have the Employess, Enginerr, htmlRender, Intern, and Manager js files that have defined classes and exports. In the output folder I have the team.html file that will host exported data. Under the templates folder I have the engineer, intern, main, and manager html files that contain the list groups items. In the test folder I have the Employee, Engineer, Intern, and Manager test js files to run the test cases.
